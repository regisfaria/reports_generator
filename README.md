# Reports_Generator

## Overview

This is an application build with Elixir to create reports from CSV files.

## Installation & Running

From now this only runs on the terminal, so you can run with:

```shell
> iex -S mix
```

Then just use `ReportGenerator.build("csv_filename.csv")` to load the desired csv file and get the report of user spendings.

This app is covered with tests, so you can run the tests with:

```shell
> mix test
```
